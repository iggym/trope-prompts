    <title>LLM Prompting Toolkit: Figures of Speech</title>
    <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
    <!-- Chosen Palette: "Warm Neutral" - A calming palette using beige, slate, stone, and a muted teal for accents to create a professional, focused, and easy-to-read environment suitable for a learning tool. -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is designed as a single-page interactive toolkit. The structure consists of a header, a category-based filter navigation bar, and a dynamic grid of cards. This was chosen for usability because it allows users to either get a broad overview ('All') or drill down into specific categories of rhetorical devices without leaving the page. Clicking a card opens a modal with detailed information (definition, examples, and LLM prompting advice). This modal approach keeps the main interface clean and prevents overwhelming the user, ensuring the focus is on one concept at a time. The flow is: User lands -> sees all figures -> filters by category (optional) -> clicks a card -> studies details in modal -> closes modal and explores another. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: The core information is textual, so the "visualization" is a structured, interactive card layout. Report Info: List of figures of speech, examples, and prompting uses. -> Goal: Organize & Inform. -> Viz/Presentation Method: An interactive card grid and a detail modal. The card provides a quick summary (name/category), and the modal provides the deep dive. -> Interaction: Users can filter the grid by clicking category buttons and view details by clicking cards. -> Justification: This two-level hierarchy (grid -> modal) is a standard, highly intuitive UI pattern for exploring a collection of items. It manages complexity well and allows for focused learning. -> Library/Method: Vanilla JavaScript for DOM manipulation and event handling, Tailwind CSS for styling. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
