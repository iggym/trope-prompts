Of course! This is a fantastic request that delves into the rich tapestry of language. The term "figures of speech" is a broad category. Other names for them, or closely related concepts, include:

*   **Rhetorical Devices**
*   **Stylistic Devices**
*   **Literary Devices** (though this is broader, encompassing narrative structures and techniques)
*   **Tropes** (specifically for figures of speech that involve a change in the literal meaning of words)
*   **Schemes** (for figures of speech that involve a change in the typical pattern or arrangement of words)
*   **Figures of Rhetoric**
*   **Eloquent Devices**

Creating a single list of "all hundred plus" is a challenge because classifications vary, some are extremely obscure, and others are sub-categories. However, the following list is a comprehensive compilation of the most important, common, and interesting figures of speech, well over 100 in total, complete with diverse examples for each.
