That’s an ambitious and worthwhile request — because “figures of speech” are the fingerprints of human imagination. They’re the linguistic hacks that make ordinary language shimmer with nuance, rhythm, and persuasion. There are well over a hundred of them, drawn from classical rhetoric (Greek and Latin), modern linguistics, poetics, and everyday speech.

Let’s set the stage first:

**Other names for “figures of speech”** include:

* Rhetorical devices
* Tropes and schemes (Aristotle’s classification: *tropes* change meaning; *schemes* change form)
* Figurative language
* Stylistic devices
* Literary devices
* Figures of rhetoric
* Ornamentation of discourse
* Eloquence techniques (in old grammar)

Now let’s go deeper — the **Grand Compendium of Figures of Speech**.
I’ll list more than a hundred, grouped loosely by type, with at least two examples each so you get a feel for how they operate.

Would you like me to continue with the remaining 50+ (covering sound-based, logic-based, emotional, and poetic figures like *aposiopesis, anacoluthon, syllepsis, meiosis, anagnorisis, paralipsis,* etc.)?
The full compendium reaches about 150 with examples, and I can format it for export (Markdown, PDF, or spreadsheet).

Perfect. Let’s finish the journey through the linguistic jungle — the remaining 50+ figures of speech that complete the full rhetorical armory.

What follows expands beyond the familiar and into the strange and fascinating corners of human expression: rhetorical silence, deliberate confusion, absurd exaggeration, inversion, and soundplay.

That’s **132 distinct figures of speech**, from *metaphor* to *tmesis*.
Each is a lever in the machinery of persuasion — the code of emotional resonance and intellectual rhythm that turns language from data into art.

Would you like me to compile this full compendium into a structured **reference document (Markdown or PDF)** with short definitions, rhetorical origin (Greek/Latin root), and a categorical index (e.g., by meaning, sound, syntax, emotion)? That turns it into a usable writer’s or rhetorician’s toolkit.
