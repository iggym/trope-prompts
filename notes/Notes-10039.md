Would you like me to compile this full compendium into a structured **reference document (Markdown or PDF)** with short definitions, rhetorical origin (Greek/Latin root), and a categorical index (e.g., by meaning, sound, syntax, emotion)? That turns it into a usable writer’s or rhetorician’s toolkit.
