Of course! This is a fantastic and ambitious question that delves deep into the heart of rhetoric and language. Let's break it down systematically.

### Part 1: Other Names for "Figures of Speech"

The term "figures of speech" is the most common umbrella term, but it has several synonyms and related concepts, each with a slightly different nuance:

*   **Rhetorical Devices:** Emphasizes their use in persuasive speaking and writing (rhetoric).
*   **Stylistic Devices:** Focuses on their role in creating literary style and effect.
*   **Literary Devices:** A very broad term that often includes figures of speech but can also encompass narrative structures, plot elements, etc.
*   **Tropes:** Specifically refers to figures of speech that involve a *change in the meaning* of words (e.g., metaphor, irony, metonymy).
*   **Schemes:** Refers to figures of speech that involve a *change in the typical pattern or order* of words (e.g., alliteration, anaphora, chiasmus).
*   **Figures of Rhetoric:** Synonymous with rhetorical devices.
*   **Eloquentia:** A classical Latin term for eloquence, achieved through the use of these figures.
*   **Colors Rhetorici:** The "colors of rhetoric," an ancient term painting them as decorative elements for language.

### Part 2: Categories of Figures of Speech with Examples

There are many ways to categorize figures of speech. One of the most useful is the classical division into **Schemes** and **Tropes**, with added categories for sound and thought.

| Category | Description | Key Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tropes** | A **change in the meaning** of a word or phrase from its literal sense. | Metaphor, Simile, Pun, Irony, Hyperbole, Metonymy. |
| **Schemes** | A **change in the standard pattern or order** of words for effect. | Anaphora, Chiasmus, Ellipsis, Antithesis. |
| **Figures of Sound** | Relies primarily on the **sound and rhythm** of words. | Alliteration, Assonance, Onomatopoeia. |
| **Figures of Thought** | Deals with the **conceptual or logical relationship** between ideas. | Rhetorical Question, Apostrophe, Paradox. |
