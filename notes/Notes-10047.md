### Other Names for Figures of Speech

Figures of speech are rhetorical or literary devices that use words in a non-literal way to create emphasis, clarity, or vividness. They are also known by various synonyms and related terms, including:

- **Tropes** (emphasizing deviation from literal meaning)
- **Rhetorical devices** (focusing on persuasive or stylistic use)
- **Figurative language** or **figurative expressions** (highlighting non-literal interpretation)
- **Turns of phrase** or **expressions** (common in everyday or idiomatic use)
- **Idioms** or **colloquialisms** (informal, regional variants)
- **Images** or **poetic equivalents** (poetic or sensory connotations)
- **Schemes** (structural variations, a subset)
- **Manner of speaking** or **way of speaking** (conversational emphasis)

These terms often overlap, with "tropes" and "rhetorical devices" being the most precise alternatives in literary analysis.

### Categories of Figures of Speech

In classical rhetoric (e.g., from Aristotle and later scholars), figures of speech are broadly divided into two main categories: **schemes** (which alter the form, order, or pattern of words) and **tropes** (which alter the usual meaning of words). These can be further subdivided based on function, such as phonetic (sound-based), syntactic (structure-based), or semantic (meaning-based). Below is a summary with 2-3 diverse examples per category/subcategory.

#### Schemes (Structural Devices)
Schemes manipulate syntax, rhythm, or repetition for effect, often enhancing sound or flow.

- **Phonetic Schemes** (sound repetition or patterns):
  - Alliteration: Repetition of initial consonant sounds (e.g., "Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers").
  - Assonance: Repetition of vowel sounds (e.g., "The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain").
  - Onomatopoeia: Words mimicking sounds (e.g., "The bees buzzed angrily").

- **Syntactic Schemes** (word order or omission):
  - Anaphora: Repetition at the start of clauses (e.g., "I have a dream... I have a dream..." from MLK's speech).
  - Asyndeton: Omission of conjunctions (e.g., "I came, I saw, I conquered").
  - Zeugma: One word linking multiple parts (e.g., "She broke his car and his heart").

- **Rhetorical Schemes** (reversal or balance):
  - Antithesis: Contrasting ideas (e.g., "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times" from *A Tale of Two Cities*).
  - Chiasmus: Reversed structure (e.g., "Ask not what your country can do for you..." from JFK).

#### Tropes (Semantic Devices)
Tropes involve substitution or extension of meaning for imagery or persuasion.

- **Comparative Tropes** (likening concepts):
  - Metaphor: Direct comparison (e.g., "All the world's a stage" from Shakespeare).
  - Simile: Comparison using "like/as" (e.g., "As brave as a lion").
  - Analogy: Extended comparison for explanation (e.g., "Life is like a box of chocolates").

- **Exaggerative Tropes** (intensification or understatement):
  - Hyperbole: Overstatement (e.g., "I'm so hungry I could eat a horse").
  - Litotes: Understatement via negation (e.g., "Not bad" meaning excellent).
  - Irony: Opposite of expected (e.g., "Great weather" during a storm).

- **Substitutive Tropes** (word replacement):
  - Metonymy: Part for whole (e.g., "The White House announced..." for the president).
  - Synecdoche: Specific for general (e.g., "All hands on deck").
  - Personification: Human traits to non-humans (e.g., "The wind whispered secrets").

These categories stem from classical divisions, with over 250 figures fitting into them across rhetoric.
